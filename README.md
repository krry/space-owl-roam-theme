# ðŸ›¸ Space Owl ðŸ¦‰ REAMDE

Herein lies a Roam theme.

It is darkish, the way an owl likes it, and a bit more spacious, comforting, and uniform than the [Night Owl by @theianjones ðŸŽ©](https://github.com/theianjones/roam-research-themes/blob/master/night-owl-ish.css) upon which it is based. Hence Space Owl.

Font-wise, the Roam interface chrome is in your `system-ui` typeface, text is in serif (I prefer NotoSerif Nerd Font from the [`powerline/fonts repo`](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)), and editables are shown in monospace (I love Space Mono for Powerline also in `powerline/fonts` and my second choice is [Fantasque Mono Sans](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans), also open source.)

## To Use

I have found that the easiest way to implement new styles in Roam is to add them to Roam. There's a quick two step process.

1. Make a new page called `roam/css`. The name is key.
2. Then copy the contents of `space-owl.md` into it. This is a markdown file containing a code block of css that forms the Space Owl theme. When you blur the textarea, the styles should save and take effect.

There are other ways, which I haven't tried because this was slick and quick. Someone also said you could use a browser plugin called Stylus.
